*we want to find every cell that has an workerID that is the same as another;
 
 
**table of workers that have multiple attempts (freqWork_id);
 
proc sql;
create table freqWork_id as
select *, COUNT(work_id) as freq
from GoodData
having COUNT(work_id)>1;
quit;
 
 
proc freq data= freqWork_id; tables work_id; run;

**creates a table freqWork_id with all features as well as a frequency count of work_id,
**we retreive this data from GoodData, and we are interested in who too our survey more than once.
